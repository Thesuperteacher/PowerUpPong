Project:

Idea: Pong game.
How does it work: there are two paddles on each side of the screen and the goal is to score. 
it can be against the computer or against another user. the keys are "w,a,s,d" for player 2 and "arrows" for player one.

everytime the ball collisions against the paddle the paddle should get some damage. the paddle should have a health bar that indicates how much health left it has. to restore the health the player has to hit a specific target with the ball.


when the ball hits a target the paddle that last touched the ball gets health back.
the target appearandomly on screen at a place that it can be hit by the ball.

    - I want the players to enter a competive state.

---

### 2. **Concept and Narrative**

- **Game Concept:**
    - a competitive ball game where 2 padels compete to score 
    - and includes power-up that lets your padel survive the collision of the ball.

### 3. **Gameplay Mechanics**

- **Core Mechanics:**
	- paddles need to hit the ball.
	- when balls collide with paddles, paddles lose health
	- random power ups show on screen, at collidible positions with the ball.
	- when ball hits health power up the health restores by 30%
	- when the ball hits the opposite side of the screen the paddle on the gets a score.
	- paddles move up and down with the "w,a,s,d" keys and "arrow" keys.

- **Rules and Objectives:**
    - when a paddle gets 10 points that paddle wins.
    - when a paddle breaks (loses all of its health) the opposite player wins.
    - Scoring or progression system
- **Player Interaction:**
    - it controls the paddles
    - if set to player vs bot the computer controls the player 2 paddle
    - if set to player vs player both playes can control their assigned paddles.
